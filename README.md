# Architect project

### For this project, I'm using the following technologies/methodologies below:

* HTML,
* CSS,
* Javascript
* Mobile First
* BEM
* Atomic Design


#### As you browse through this project, you should expect a fully responsive website. I am also applying ARIA properties to provide accessibility for those who needs. As I'm not a UI/UX Designer, you should focus only on the implemented technologies/methodologies i mentionedd above.

#### This website is best reproduced on latest version of Google Chrome.

###### P.S. If you have any contribution or feedback regards to this project, I'll be very happy to hear from you!
